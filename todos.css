/*
  Find two Google Fonts:
    * The first should be for headings
    * The second should be for general text

  Find a FLAT UI color:
    * http://www.flatuicolorpicker.com/
    * Be sure to make sure the font color contrasts with the color
      * If the color is darker the font should be white
      * If the color is lighter it should be black
    * MAKE THIS YOUR body background color!

  Going forward
    * Style all elements as some rgba() that's
      some shade of gray with some alpha transparency
    * The goal here is to make elements darker or lighter
      but have the color for entire page never change

  Add Style for a .form class
  Add Style for a generic .container class
    * Containers should be centered
    * Should have a width of 80%

  Add a style for a .todo
